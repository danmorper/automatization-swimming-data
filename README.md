# Automating Swimming Data Collection
This project focuses on automating the collection of swimming-related data using various techniques:

-Web Scraping: I utilize Selenium for web scraping tasks.

-Data Cleaning: I perform extensive data cleaning operations to extract data from PDF files.

##Â clubs.py
The clubs.py script is responsible for retrieving a comprehensive list of swimming teams located in Spain. This information is obtained through web scraping from the official website: https://rfen.es/es/clubs.

## exec.py
exec.py serves as the central script for executing various automation tasks within the project. Additionally, it measures the execution time of these tasks and records the results in a file named time.txt.
